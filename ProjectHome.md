This game is a computer implementation of paper-sheet game (kind of Tic-tac-toe).

I've started to write this game years ago while learning C#, so there were all kinds of smelling spaghetti code. Currently the game is being (slowly) rewritten almost from scratch, with UI in WPF. There is an old game version installer in Downloads section, and debug build of new version.

New version works quite well, it just lacks some menu options, etc. Here is a couple of screenshots:
